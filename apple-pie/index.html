      <p>
        This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another
        one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several
        first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
        favorites as well!

      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Directions Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the
          butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white
          sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let
          simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
          slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and
          butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350
          degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until
          apples are soft.
        </li>
